# Location and Geology Map Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This project aims to classify Location and geology maps through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks. The dataset contains distinct map images we need to train our CNN model to detect different map types .

## Libraries required
To run the code and train the model, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pytorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Pillow
